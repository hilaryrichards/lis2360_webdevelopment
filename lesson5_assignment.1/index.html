        <h2><i>The use of technology in our everyday education</i></h2>
        <p>The 21st century is full of the latest gizmo's and gagets, but how is this effecting our educaiton and how the children are learning everything from their ABC's to algebra? Explore our website to learn more about educational technology. We will talk about the negative and positive impacts of technology in the classroom. We will also explore educational technology outside of schools and how it enters our everyday life.</p>
        <p>Tablets are replacing our textbooks. Technology has not only changed how educators teach their students, but it has reshaped the way students are learning. One benifit we see in using technology in education is that it makes it more fun to learn. Students have become more interested in learning when it involves tablets, computers, SmartBoards, ect. Playing educational games online can make a student feel like their just playing, while in fact they are learning without even knowing it. </p>
        <p>Another benifit to virtual lessons versus traditional lessons in the fact that students can learn at their own pace. Many new schools are using this method because it allows students to spend more time on subjects they aren't quite grasping yet, while other students can move on if they have mastered a topic. According to a study from TeachHub.com, technology actually helped the students retain the information better. In the study, 18 2nd grade students were challenged to complete a Power Point project about an animal. Sixteen out of the 18 students remembered more facts about the animal after completing the presentation. These results show that technology indeed helps students remember what they learn.</p>
        <p>Educational technology does not just benefit the students, but the teachers as well. Teachers love using new technology in their classrooms because it creates a way for all of the students to stay connected and keep the classroom managable. Students can often use a classroom website to chat with other studnets, ask the teacher questions, and even check their grades, results, and feedback. Technology also saves teachers time, and not to mention money they spend on paper. Before, teachers spent hours on creating lesson plans and grading papers, but they can now find free lesson plans and resources online, and use programs that help them grade faster and easier.  </p>
        <p><i>According to a study by IT Trade Association, <q>around 75% of educators think that technology has a positive impact in the education process.</q></i></p>
