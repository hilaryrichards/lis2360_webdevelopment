             <p>My name is Hilary Richards, and I'm a 4th year senior here at Florida State University. My major is Humanities with a concentration in media and communications. I am from the beautiful beaches of Seaside, Florida, and I spend most of my time relaxing on the beach, serving at one of the local restaurants, and hanging out with my friends; but some of the best days are filled with slobbery kisses from my 2 year old Great Dane, Yadi. </p>
             <p>Explore my website to learn more about the pros and cons of technology's effect on education, both inside and outside of the classroom.</p>

<p>This is a custom analogous color palette that I created to match with the fun, bright colors in my website's photos. The bright blues and greens remind me of classrooms and schools, which really brings my educational technology theme to life.</p>
